## 🎨 Component Architecture

The project uses a component-based architecture with two main types of components:

1. **Custom Components**: Located in `src/components/custom/`
   - Custom made components Specific to the application
   - Built using shadcn/ui components as building blocks
   - Examples: ProfileSection, ProjectCard, Header

2. **UI Components**: Located in `src/components/ui/`
   - Generated by [shadcn/ui cli](https://ui.shadcn.com/)
   - Highly reusable and customizable
   - Styled using Tailwind CSS
   - Examples: Button, Card, Avatar

## 💅 Why shadcn/ui?

[shadcn/ui](https://ui.shadcn.com/) was chosen for this project because it provides:
- High-quality, accessible components
- Full customization control
- No external dependencies
- Copy-paste component approach for better control
- Tailwind CSS integration
- Radix UI primitives for accessibility

## 📦 Why pnpm?

pnpm was chosen as the package manager for several reasons:
- Faster installation times compared to npm and yarn
- Disk space efficiency through content-addressable storage
- Strict dependency resolution
- Better security through strict dependency isolation

## 🚀 Deployment

The project can be deployed to any platform that supports Next.js applications. For example, to deploy to Vercel:

1. Push your code to GitHub
2. Import your repository to Vercel
3. Vercel will automatically detect Next.js and deploy your application

## 📝 Development Notes

- Use `pnpm format` to format code using Prettier
- Use `pnpm lint` to run ESLint
- Use `pnpm build` to create a production build
- The project uses Next.js 14's app directory structure
- Components are built with TypeScript for type safety
- Tailwind CSS is used for styling with a custom theme configuration
